		///
		/// - ExactCount: This request is for a specific number of devices.
		///   This is the default. The exact number is provided in the
		///   count field.
		///
		/// - All: This request is for all of the matching devices in a pool.
		///   At least one device must exist on the node for the allocation to succeed.
		///   Allocation will fail if some devices are already allocated,
		///   unless adminAccess is requested.
