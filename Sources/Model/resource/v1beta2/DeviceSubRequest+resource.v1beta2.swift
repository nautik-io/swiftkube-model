	/// DeviceSubRequest describes a request for device provided in the claim.spec.devices.requests[].firstAvailable array. Each is typically a request for a single resource like a device, but can also ask for several identical devices.
	///
	/// DeviceSubRequest is similar to ExactDeviceRequest, but doesn't expose the AdminAccess field as that one is only supported when requesting a specific device.
	///

		///
		/// AllocationMode and its related fields define how devices are allocated to satisfy this subrequest. Supported values are:
		///
		/// - ExactCount: This request is for a specific number of devices.
		///   This is the default. The exact number is provided in the
		///   count field.
		///
		/// - All: This subrequest is for all of the matching devices in a pool.
		///   Allocation will fail if some devices are already allocated,
		///   unless adminAccess is requested.
		///
		/// If AllocationMode is not specified, the default mode is ExactCount. If the mode is ExactCount and count is not specified, the default count is one. Any other subrequests must specify this field.
		///
		/// More modes may get added in the future. Clients must refuse to handle requests with unknown modes.
		///
		public var allocationMode: String?
		///
		/// Count is used only when the count mode is "ExactCount". Must be greater than zero. If AllocationMode is ExactCount and this field is not specified, the default is one.

		///
		/// DeviceClassName references a specific DeviceClass, which can define additional configuration and selectors to be inherited by this subrequest.
		///
		/// A class is required. Which classes are available depends on the cluster.
		///
		/// Administrators may use this to restrict which devices may get requested by only installing classes with selectors for permitted devices. If users are free to request anything without restrictions, then administrators can create an empty DeviceClass for users to reference.

		/// If specified, the request's tolerations.

		/// Tolerations for NoSchedule are required to allocate a device which has a taint with that effect. The same applies to NoExecute.
		///
		/// In addition, should any of the allocated devices get tainted with NoExecute after allocation and that effect is not tolerated, then all pods consuming the ResourceClaim get deleted to evict them. The scheduler will not let new pods reserve the claim while it has these tainted devices. Once all pods are evicted, the claim will get deallocated.
